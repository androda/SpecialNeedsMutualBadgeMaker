---IMAGE PREPARATION---
-Image Naming:
--Name your images 'firstname lastname.jpg', like "Bob Dole.jpg" or "Agatha Christie.jpg"
--If someone has two first names like "Anne Marie Jones" then you need to name the picture "Anne%Marie Jones.jpg" This is so the system knows to put "Anne Marie" on the same line.  Do the same thing with multiple last names (unless you want each name to appear on its own line, in which case put spaces between all of them).
-Image sizing:
--Your images should be of 0.8:1 aspect ratio (x-axis is 0.8, y-axis is 1)

---USING THE BADGE MAKER---
-Running the badge maker:
"Double click on the specialNeedsMutualBadgeMaker.jar" file

-BADGE MAKER INTERACTION
-First, select the image source directory - this is where all pictures will come from in the generated PDF.  You cannot select multiple directories.

-You will be shown a summary of the total number of images discovered and how many pages it will take to create the badges.  3 badges fit on each page.

-Next, choose your settings.  If you have not scaled your images down to 126 pixels by 158 pixels, you will need to use the 'auto-scale pictures' option or the badges will look terrible.  This will make badge generation take much longer.

-If you want to 'Detect Badge Type From Picture Naming' then you need to give each name badge a prefix to tell the badge maker if it's an adult leader, youth counselor, or special needs youth.  The prefix for Adult Leaders is 'A_' (without the '').  The prefix for Youth counselors is 'Y_' (without the '') and the prefix for Special Needs Youth is 'S_' (without the '').  You can then place all name badges in the same directory and the Badge Maker will auto-sort and auto-rename them to remove the type prefix.

-If you don't want to auto-detect badge type, then sort the three types into their own folders and use the selector for which type you want - 'Adult Leader', 'Youth Counselor', or 'Special Needs Youth'. 

-Once you have made all your selections, click 'Make Badges' and wait for the process to complete.

-I have attempted to make a progress bar which shows how much of the process is complete, but I don't know if it's working properly just yet.  Making 80 or 90 badges doesn't take very long if you are NOT using the auto-scale option.  If you are auto-scaling then all bets are off for how long it will take.  Depending on the speed of your computer it could be minutes or hours.

-If you need to change settings like font size or location of the image or whatever, edit the 'resources/snmBadge.properties file'. Use the 'Change Settings' button to select this file after you have updated it.

--NOTES--
-Using the 'Auto-Scale Pictures' option will more than double the time it takes to make each badge.  It's very convenient, but takes longer.  It does NOT re-scale the original images.  It copies the original and sizes it down before using it to make the badge.
