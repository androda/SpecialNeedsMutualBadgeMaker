---IMAGE PREPARATION---
-Image Naming:
--Name your images 'firstname lastname.jpg', like "Bob Dole.jpg" or "Agatha Christie.jpg"
--If someone has two first names like "Anne Marie Jones" then you need to name the picture "Anne%Marie Jones.jpg" This is so the system knows to put "Anne Marie" on the same line.  Do the same thing with multiple last names (unless you want each name to appear on its own line, in which case put spaces between all of them).
-Image sizing:
--Your images should be of 0.8:1 aspect ratio (x-axis is 0.8, y-axis is 1)

---USING THE BADGE MAKER---
-Running the badge maker:
If you don't need to change any settings (settings as in picture placement, font size, etc) then use the specialNeedsMutualBadgeMaker.jar.

Run this command on your command prompt:
java -jar specialNeedsMutualBadgeMaker.jar

If you need to make changes to picture or name positioning, font sizing, or whatever else, then it's a little more complex.  Copy these files into a folder somewhere (make sure they are all at the same level in the folder): specialNeedsMutualBadgeMaker_needsExternalProps.jar, itextpdf-5.4.6-SNAPSHOT.jar, resources/snmBadge.properties.  Make your changes to snmBadge.properties and save.

Open a command prompt and 'cd' into the directory where these files are.  Then run this command to start the badge maker:
java -cp specialNeedsMutualBadgeMaker_needsExternalProps.jar;itextpdf-5.4.6-SNAPSHOT.jar;. com.specialneedsmutual.badgemaker.BadgeMakerWindow

-BADGE MAKER INTERACTION
-First, select the image source directory - this is where all pictures will come from in the generated PDF.  You cannot select multiple directories.
-You will be shown a summary of the total number of images discovered and how many pages it will take to create the badges.  3 badges fit on each page.
-Next, choose your settings.  If you have not scaled your images down to 126 pixels by 158 pixels, you will need to use the 'auto-scale pictures' option or the badges will look terrible.  This will make badge generation take much longer.
-If you want to 'Detect Badge Type From Picture Naming' then you need to give each name badge a prefix to tell the badge maker if it's an adult leader, youth counselor, or special needs youth.  The prefix for Adult Leaders is 'A_' (without the '').  The prefix for Youth counselors is 'Y_' (without the '') and the prefix for Special Needs Youth is 'S_' (without the '').  You can then place all name badges in the same directory and the Badge Maker will auto-sort and auto-rename them to remove the type prefix.
-If you don't want to auto-detect badge type, then sort the three types into their own folders and use the selector for which type you want - 'Adult Leader', 'Youth Counselor', or 'Special Needs Youth'. 
-Once you have made all your selections, click 'Make Badges' and wait for the process to complete.
-I have attempted to make a progress bar which shows how much of the process is complete, but I don't know if it's working properly just yet.  Making 80 or 90 badges doesn't take very long if you are NOT using the auto-scale option.  If you are auto-scaling then all bets are off for how long it will take.  Depending on the speed of your computer it could be minutes or hours.
--NOTES--
-Using the 'Auto-Scale Pictures' option will more than double the time it takes to make each badge.  It's very convenient, but takes longer.  It does NOT re-scale the original images.  It copies the original and sizes it down before using it to make the badge.
